# Solar System

- The aim of this project was to utilise JavaScript to display different elements of text based on which tab the client clicks on.
- I also wanted to use CSS to create an overlay so it appears like the user is reading off of a "space" terminal.
- I learnt a lot regarding Date objects and interacting with the DOM to manipulate html in JavaScript.
